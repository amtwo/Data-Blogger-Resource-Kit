## Licence
In 2019, Stack Exchange Inc. unilaterally announced that the licence would be changed from [CC-BY-SA version 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) to [version 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). As such, old content is licensed under version 3.0 while newer one runs under 4.0, but it is difficult to determine which licence applies to a particular piece of content. The 2016 MIT licence situation further complicates licensing. Please refer to these discussions on Meta SE for more details: [Stack Exchange and Stack Overflow have moved to CC BY-SA 4.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333089/stack-exchange-and-stack-overflow-have-moved-to-cc-by-sa-4-0) and [The MIT License â€“ Clarity on Using Code on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271080/the-mit-license-clarity-on-using-code-on-stack-overflow-and-stack-exchange).
